## 🧭 Ontology of Iranian Tribes

During a series of scholarly meetings held at the **National Library and Archives of Iran**, a comprehensive list of Iranian tribes was compiled. Participants included **Dr. Torkashvand**, **Narges Ghadimi**, and **Rezagholi**, in collaboration with **Dr. Gholamreza Amirkhani**, **Ata Ahmadi**, and **Fariborz Khosravi**.

Following the initial compilation, the accuracy of the data was reviewed in collaboration with provincial authorities. Each province's list was submitted to the respective governor’s office for validation and correction. Once finalized, the idea of transforming this data into a formal ontology was proposed, approved by the **Research Council**, and implemented using **Protégé**, the open-source ontology editor developed at Stanford University. The continued collaboration and expertise of Dr. Torkashvand were instrumental throughout the process.

The **Ontology of Iranian Tribes** represents a large-scale and relatively comprehensive knowledge base of tribal structures in Iran. It includes thousands of classes for tribes, clans, lineages, households, associated regions, and related concepts—along with hundreds of individual instances.
